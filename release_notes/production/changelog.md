### Visit Feral File exhibitions
- Visit Feral File Exhibitions on the app, starting with the current show, +GRAPH. Past exhibitions will be made available for subscribers.

### Live with digital art
- Stream digital artwork to any compatible screen. Share and enjoy your favorite pieces with family, friends, and colleagues at home and in the office.
- For interactive works, your mobile device becomes the remote control. Use the keyboard, experiment with the artist’s commands, and dive into the immersive world of software-based art.

### Organize your collection
- Consolidate collected digital art across blockchains (Ethereum and Tezos) 
- Create collections within your collection. 
- The app classifies artwork into 3 categories: Still, Video, Interactive.
- Artworks by the same artist are automatically grouped into collections.

### You can still:
- Co-create a digital chain letter with MoMA Postcard. This experiment in borderless collaboration and creativity explores ways individuals, groups, and institutions can make and own digital goods.
- The “View existing address” feature allows you to see other collections and share yours with friends. In other words, you can go beyond ownership and enjoy digital art.
