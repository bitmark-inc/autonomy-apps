## Release Notes Creation Guidance:
### Version number
- (must) consist of three numbers separated by dots
```
The leftmost number (1) is called the major version.
The middle number (2) is called the minor version.
The rightmost number (3) is called the revision but it may also be referred to as a "point release" or "subminor version".
```
