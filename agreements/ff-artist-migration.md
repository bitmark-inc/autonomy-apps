# Feral File Artist Agreement \- \[PLATFORM\]

**\[ARTIST NAME\]**

As we have discussed and as we understand \[PLATFORM\] has discussed with you, in order to preserve the availability of your artwork, \[PLATFORM\] has transferred to Bitmark Inc. (“we” “us” “our” “Feral File”) its rights in the digital artwork you previously transferred to \[PLATFORM\] (the “\[PLATFORM\] Works”), including its rights under the blockchain smart contracts associated with the NFTs of the \[PLATFORM\] Works.

In addition to the rights we have received from \[PLATFORM\], we would like to continue to make your artwork available through our platform, Feral File, which consists of an online gallery and a digital wallet with local display functionality.

Below are the terms of our agreement for your work to be exhibited on Feral File.

## Applicable Terms

By signing this document below, you agree to the following:

- You will establish an Artist Account on the Feral File platform. We will provide assistance in doing so should you request it.  
    
- In establishing the Artist Account on the Feral File platform, you agree to the current version of the [Feral File Terms for Artists and Collectors](https://feralfile.com/legal/terms-artists-and-collectors). You also agree that we may change the Terms for Artists and Collectors from time to time as set forth therein.  
    
- You hereby transfer and grant to Feral File the rights in the \[PLATFORM\] Works transferred and granted to Collectors and to Feral File under the [Agreement of Original Transfer of Work of Digital Art](https://feralfile.com/legal/agreement-original-transfer-work-digital-art).

## Subsequent Transfers

Section 1 and the referenced documents notwithstanding, funds received from transfers of the \[PLATFORM\] Works after the date on which \[PLATFORM\] transferred its rights in the relevant smart contracts to Feral File will be paid according to the terms of the relevant smart contracts, not according to the terms of the documents referenced in Section 1\. You will receive amounts payable to you directly in your preferred web3 wallet, which you must designate using the Feral File Admin interface.

You understand and agree that this agreement, together with the documents referenced in this agreement, supersedes all prior understandings regarding its subject matter.
