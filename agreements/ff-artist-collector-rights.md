# Artist & Collector Rights

## 1\. Artist Rights

When you sell your artwork on Feral File, the following rights are guaranteed to you by legal contract and by the Feral File smart contract:

- **You own the copyright and image rights.**  
  This means collectors can’t copy, reproduce, or make derivatives of your work—but you still can.  
    
- **You earn a percentage of all secondary sales.**  
  If a collector buys your work and then sells it for a profit, you’re entitled to a percentage of the sale price as stated in the term sheet containing the commercial terms for the exhibition and sale of the work on Feral File, less any transaction fees.  
    
- **You will always be credited.**  
  Anytime your work is displayed or shared, it must be properly attributed to you.  
    
- **Your work is protected.**  
  Collectors can’t modify, distort, or otherwise misrepresent your work when they display it.  
    
- **You’ll know when your work changes hands.**  
  Information about your work’s provenance and subsequent sales will be recorded on a public blockchain.  
    
- **You grant collectors certain rights to use, display, and resell your work.**  
  Learn what collectors can do with your work in the [Art Sale Agreement](https://feralfile.com/legal/art-sale-agreement).  
    
- **You’ll retain these rights forever.**  
  No matter where the future takes us, your rights as the artist are protected in perpetuity.

## 2\. Collector Rights

When you collect an artist’s work on Feral File, you have the right to do the following:

- **Download the work.**  
  As a collector, you’ll have access to a permanent link where you can download the work’s original full-resolution files and technical details.  
    
- **Display the work.**  
  Using the artist’s installation guidelines, you have the right to display the work both privately and publicly.  
    
- **Be assured of the work’s authenticity.**  
  Feral File guarantees the provenance of every work using a public blockchain.  
    
- **Loan or lease the work.**  
  You may grant others the temporary right to display the work.  
    
- **Resell or transfer your rights in the work.**  
  You are entitled to transfer your rights to the work to another collector or entity. You must transfer all of your rights in the work and delete all copies of the work in your possession or control. If you resell or otherwise receive compensation for the transfer (or loss) of your rights in the work, the artist, Feral File, and in certain cases, other involved parties must be paid a percentage of the amount you receive as stated in the collector rights disclosure presented to you before purchase of the work.  
    
- **Allow the work to be displayed as part of a playlist.**  
  If the Artist agrees, you may allow the work to be displayed as part of a rotating playlist to individual user devices all over the world. If you receive compensation for such display of the work, the artist, Feral File, and in certain cases, other involved parties must be paid a percentage of the amount you receive as stated in the collector rights disclosure presented to you before purchase of the work.  
    
- **Remain anonymous.**  
  While all sales are recorded publicly, you can use an alias to keep your collection private.  
    
- **Respect the artist’s rights.**  
  Feral File protects artists by forefronting their rights just like we forefront your rights as a collector. Learn more in the [Art Sale Agreement](https://feralfile.com/legal/art-sale-agreement).  
    
- **You’ll retain these rights for as long as the law allows.**  
  Your rights are guaranteed for as long as the law allows, until you resell or transfer ownership of your rights in the work.
