## Licenses to Work; No Termination

Sponsor and Artist grant the Collector, solely for so long as the Collector owns the corresponding NFT Record, the worldwide, irrevocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable (except to the transferee of Collector’s Digital Property subject to this Agreement), non-sublicensable right to:

- (b) If and as permitted by the Artist, install, run (if applicable), and publicly display the Work in accordance with the Artist’s instructions.

The rights above may be sublicensed for a reasonable period to a third party to permit private or public display of the Work, subject to a binding license agreement consistent with this Agreement. The License may be transferred only as a whole and only to a recipient of the Digital Property transferred in accordance with this Agreement and is automatically transferred to such recipient upon the transfer of the Digital Property, as recorded in an NFT Record.

The Artist waives, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, any right under any applicable law or regulation to terminate the licenses granted hereunder or any element thereof.
