# Feral File App End User License Agreement

**Last Updated: 20-SEP 2024**

## Introduction

This End User License Agreement (this "Agreement") governs the terms and conditions of your use of the binary version of the software that accompanies this Agreement (the "Software") and is made between you ("you" or "your") and Bitmark Inc. (“Feral File” "we" "us" or "our"). If you are acting on behalf of an entity such as a corporation, partnership, limited liability company, or other entity, "you" refers to the entity, and you represent and warrant that you have power and authority to enter into this Agreement on behalf of the entity.

By clicking the "Accept" button for this Agreement and/or using the Software, you confirm your acceptance of and agree to be bound by this Agreement. You also agree to our Privacy Policy and the terms for any premium features which we present to you at the time you purchase access to those features.

The Software is independent of our Feral File digital artwork market platform. You may use one or the other or both.

## Open Source

The Software is primarily made available under open source licenses. It contains a “Legal Notices” section which lists the open source software licenses for its components, and you may visit [GitHub](https://github.com/bitmark-inc/feralfile-app) for a copy of the source code, which we own and have made available under an open source license. Open source software licenses for the Software source code constitute separate written agreements.

## Limited Right to Use

Subject to your compliance with the other terms and conditions of this Agreement, for those elements of the Software not made available under an open source license agreement (including any features made available from our servers), we hereby grant to you a limited non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable right to copy and use the Software on one or more devices you own, including to access the features made available from our servers, solely for your personal or internal business purposes. You agree not to use the Software for any other purpose, provide a third party with access, publish, distribute, transmit, or create a derivative work of, or otherwise exploit any portion of the Software without our prior written permission. Certain features accessible in or through the Software may be subject to additional or separate terms presented at the time you request access to such additional features.

## Catalog Display

You may elect to use the App to display certain third-party digital artwork (“Catalog Works”) on the App and (if you have subscribed to the relevant Premium Features) to external display devices. Feral File and its licensors grant you the right to display and perform the Catalog Works made available to you under your Premium Feature subscription only within the App and on the relevant third-party devices only for your own personal use and only in the form, format, sequence, and for the period of time made available to you as set forth in the description of the Premium Feature to which you have subscribed. All other rights are expressly reserved by Feral File and its licensors, and any other use or exploitation of the Catalog Works is expressly prohibited. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, any recording, reproduction, distribution, or public display or performance of any Catalog Works is expressly prohibited.

## Ownership

You agree that the Software and all intellectual property rights in the Software are owned by us and/or our suppliers. You agree not to decompile or reverse engineer any of the Software except to the extent permitted by applicable law and not to circumvent or interfere with any security or activation functionality if used in or with the Software. You shall not modify or remove any copyright or other notices contained in or displayed on any Software. We reserve all rights not specifically granted above, subject to any separate open source software licenses in the Software or components thereof. You may choose to submit comments, information, or feedback to us regarding the Software or services to us orally or in writing, and if you do so, you hereby grant us a non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, sublicensable right to use the same in any manner for any purpose without compensation to you.

## Premium Features and Subscriptions

You may purchase access to premium features available in or through the Software (“Premium Feature(s)”). If you purchase an auto-renewing periodic subscription to Premium Feature(s) through the Software, your account will be billed continuously for the subscription until you terminate it as set forth below. After your initial subscription period and again after any subsequent subscription period, your subscription will automatically renew for an additional equivalent period. If you do not wish your subscription to renew automatically, or if you want to change or terminate your subscription, you will need to follow the instructions provided in the Software to terminate or change your subscription, even if you have deleted your account.

We may manage, regulate, control, modify, or eliminate Premium Feature(s) at any time with or without notice. We may revise the pricing for the Software and Premium Feature(s) at any time. We shall have no liability to you or any third party in the event that we exercise any such rights.

Certain Premium Feature(s) may be subject to additional or separate terms presented at the time you request access to such additional Premium Features.

You agree to pay all fees and applicable taxes incurred by you or anyone using the copy of the Software installed on your device. All information that you provide in connection with a purchase transaction or other monetary interaction with the Software must be accurate, complete, and current. You agree to pay all charges incurred by users of your credit card, debit card, or other payment method at the prices in effect when such charges are incurred. You will pay any applicable taxes, if any, relating to any such purchases, transactions, or other monetary transaction interactions.

All payments are non-refundable. There are no refunds or credits for Premium Feature(s) or partially used subscription periods. However, we may grant refunds or credits on a case-by-case basis at our sole discretion. Our grant of a refund or credit in one instance does not obligate us to provide a refund or credit in the future under any circumstances. If you cancel your periodic subscription to Premium Feature(s), you will continue to have access to the Premium Feature(s) through the end of your current billing period.

## Termination

This Agreement is effective until terminated. You may terminate this Agreement at any time by destroying all copies of the Software in your possession or control. We strongly recommend that you cancel your subscription to any Premium Feature(s) before doing so. This Agreement will terminate immediately without notice from us if you fail to comply with any provision of this Agreement. Upon termination, you must destroy all copies of the Software in your possession or control.

## Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability

IN NO EVENT SHALL WE BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES; LOSS OF USE, DATA, SAVINGS, OR PROFITS; OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION) IN EACH CASE HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE), ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SOFTWARE OR OTHERWISE IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

OUR ENTIRE LIABILITY UNDER THIS AGREEMENT SHALL NOT EXCEED THE TOTAL FEES PAID, IF ANY, BY YOU UNDER THIS AGREEMENT.
