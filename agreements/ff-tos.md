## 14\. Copyright Dispute Policy

Feral File has adopted the following general policy toward copyright infringement in accordance with the United States’ Digital Millennium Copyright Act or DMCA (posted at [http://www.copyright.gov/legislation/dmca.pdf](http://www.copyright.gov/legislation/dmca.pdf)).  
The address of Feral File's Designated Agent to Receive Notification of Claimed Infringement ("Designated Agent'') is listed at the end of this Section. It is Feral File's policy to:

- (1) block access to or remove material that it believes in good faith to be copyrighted material that has been illegally copied and distributed; and  
- (2) remove and discontinue service to repeat offenders.

### Procedure for Reporting Copyright Infringements

If you believe that material or content residing on or accessible through the Website infringes a copyright, please send a notice of copyright infringement containing the following information to the Designated Agent listed below:

- A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright that has been allegedly infringed;  
- Specific identification of the copyrighted works or materials being infringed;  
- Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing, including information regarding the location of the infringing materials that the copyright owner seeks to have removed with sufficient detail so that Feral File is capable of finding and verifying its existence;  
- Contact information about the notifier including address, telephone number, and if available, email address;  
- A statement that the notifier has a good faith belief that the material identified in (3) is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and  
- A statement requesting that Feral File take a specific act with respect to the alleged infringement (e.g. removal, access restricted, or disabled); and  
- A statement made under penalty of perjury that the information provided is accurate and the notifying party is authorized to make the complaint on behalf of the copyright owner.

Once proper bona fide infringement notification is received by the Designated Agent, it is Feral File's policy to:

- Remove or disable access to the infringing material;  
- Notify the content provider or user that it has removed or disabled access to the material; and  
- That repeat offenders will have the infringing material removed from the system and that Feral File will terminate such content provider's or user's access to the Website.

### Procedure to Supply a Counter-Notice

If the content provider or user believes that the material that was removed (or to which access was disabled) is not infringing, or the content provider or user believes that it has the right to post and use such material from the copyright owner, the copyright owner's agent, or pursuant to the law, the content provider or user must send a counter-notice containing the following information to the Designated Agent listed below:

- A physical or electronic signature of the content provider or user;  
- Identification of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or disabled;  
- A statement that the content provider or user has a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material; and  
- Content provider's or user's name, address, telephone number, and if available, email address, and a statement that such person or entity consents to the jurisdiction of the Federal Court for the judicial district in which the content provider's, member's, or user's address is located, or if the content provider's, member's, or user's address is located outside the United States, for any judicial district in which Feral File is located, and that such person or entity will accept service of process from the person who provided notification of the alleged infringement.

If a counter-notice is received by the Designated Agent, Feral File may send a copy of the counter-notice to the original complaining party informing that person that Feral File may replace the removed material or cease disabling it in 10 business days. Unless the copyright owner files an action seeking a court order against the content provider, member, or user, the removed material may be replaced or access to it restored in 10 to 14 business days or more after receipt of the counter-notice, at Feral File's discretion.
