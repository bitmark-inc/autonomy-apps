Bitmark Inc. (“we” “us” “our” “Feral File”) provides this Privacy Policy to inform users of our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personally identifiable information received from users of the Feral File website located at the [https://feralfile.com](https://feralfile.com) domain and subdomains (the "Website"). Any terms not defined in this Privacy Policy are defined in the Feral File [Terms of Service](https://feralfile.com/docs/terms-of-service). Please note that this Privacy Policy only applies to this Website and does not apply to the offer of artwork for sale or the purchase of artwork. Information regarding the use and handling of personal information in connection with those activities is contained in the agreements specific to those activities listed [here](https://feralfile.com/docs/terms-of-artist-collector).

## Website Information Collection and Use

It is not necessary to provide Feral File with your personally identifiable information to use the Website, and Feral File does not collect personally identifiable information in connection with the operation of the Website.

If you contact Feral File by email or through the Website, Feral File may keep a record of your contact information and correspondence and may use your email address and any information that you provide to Feral File in your message to respond to you. Feral File uses commercially reasonable efforts to keep this information and to delete it when keeping it is no longer necessary, but has no obligation to keep this information confidential nor to take any specific security measures to protect this information.

When you visit the Website, Feral File’s servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website ("Log Data"). This Log Data may include information such as your IP address, browser type, or the domain from which you are visiting. For most users accessing the Internet from an Internet service provider, the IP address may be different every time you log on. Feral File uses Log Data to monitor the use of the Website and the services we offer via the Website and for the Website’s technical administration.

As a general matter, we use information we collect from you through the Website to monitor, research, analyze, and report on the use of the Website, to administer, operate, and improve the Website and our business, to process transactions relating to the use of the Website, and to enforce or exercise any rights in our terms and conditions and enforce compliance with laws and law enforcement.

## Cookies

Like many websites, Feral File also uses "cookie" technology to collect additional website usage data and to improve the Website and the services offered via the Website. A cookie is a small data file that Feral File’s servers transfer to your computer’s hard disk. Feral File does not use cookies to collect personally identifiable information. However, IP addresses are collected by the use of cookies. Feral File mainly uses "session cookies," which enable certain features of the Website and services offered via the Website to better understand how you interact with the Website and services we offer via the Website, to monitor aggregate usage by our users and web traffic routing on the Website, and to improve the Website and services offered via the Website. This session cookie should be deleted from your computer when you disconnect from or leave the Website. Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies. You can instruct your browser by editing its options to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. Please note, however, that if you don’t accept cookies, you may not be able to access all portions or features of certain websites.

## Web Beacons

We or our email service provider may also use “web beacons” or “tracking pixels.” Web beacons or tracking pixels are small graphic images in email messages to determine whether the messages were opened and the links were clicked. If you choose not to receive web beacons / tracking pixels in your emails, you will need to disable HTML images in your email program, but that may affect images in other emails you receive.

## Specific Service Providers

Presently, the only third-party analytics service providers we use are [PostHog](https://posthog.com/privacy) and [Google Analytics](https://policies.google.com/privacy).

## Do Not Track

We use only session cookies as described above. We do not use cookies to collect personally identifiable information or track users’ online activities over time and across different Websites. For more information regarding Do Not Track mechanisms, see [http://allaboutdnt.com](http://allaboutdnt.com).

## Information Shared with Others

We may engage third-party service providers to work with us to administer and provide the Website. These third-party service providers have access to information collected through the Website only for the purpose of performing services on our behalf.

We may share aggregated information and information about users (but not personally identifiable information) with third parties for industry analysis, targeted advertising, demographic profiling, and other similar purposes.

Information collected through the Website is considered to be a business asset. As a result, if we go out of business or enter bankruptcy, or if we are acquired as a result of a transaction such as a merger, acquisition, or asset sale, the information collected through the Website may be disclosed or transferred to the third-party acquirer in connection with the transaction.

It is our policy to protect you from having your privacy violated through abuse of the legal systems, whether by individuals, entities, or government, and to contest claims that we believe to be invalid under applicable law. However, it is also our policy to cooperate with government and law enforcement officials and private parties. Accordingly, we reserve the right to disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary: (a) to satisfy or comply with any applicable law, regulation, or legal process or to respond to lawful requests, including subpoenas, warrants, or court orders; (b) to enforce our agreements with you or third parties, to protect our property rights and safety, and the rights, property, and safety of third parties or the public in general; and (c) to prevent or stop activity we consider to be illegal or unethical.

## Security

We take reasonable measures to protect from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure of the information that we collect. Please be aware, however, that no method of transmitting information over the Internet or storing information is completely secure. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of any information.

## Your Rights in Your Data

Feral File doesn't collect, process, or disclose your personal information in connection with the Website except as we describe in this Privacy Policy. You may have the right under applicable laws of various countries or US States concerning your personal data, such as under EU or California law, the right to access, rectification, or erasure of, and/or restriction of processing or objection to processing of your personal information. If you wish to exercise your rights with respect to personal information collected or processed by Feral File in connection with the Website, contact us via email at [support@feralfile.com](mailto:support@feralfile.com), and we will respond to you with specific instructions to follow.

If you are a resident in the European Union, you also have the right to, at no cost, lodge a complaint with EU data protection authorities. This right may also exist in other countries.

## International Transfer

Your information (including personally identifiable information) may be transferred to and maintained on computers located outside of your state, province, country, or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. By using the Website, you consent to this transfer.

## Links to Other Sites

The Website may contain links to other Websites ("Linked Sites") operated by Feral File or third parties. Linked Sites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data, or solicit personal information from you. This Privacy Policy addresses only the use and disclosure of information that Feral File collects through this Website. Other sites follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the personal information you submit to them. Feral File does not exercise control over third-party Linked Sites. Your use of any Linked Site operated by Feral File is subject to the terms and conditions provided by Feral File for such Linked Site. Feral File encourages you to read the privacy policies or statements of the other websites you visit.

## Our Policy Towards Children

This Website is not directed to children under 18\. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided Feral File with personally identifiable information without their consent, he or she should contact Feral File at [support@feralfile.com](mailto:support@feralfile.com). If Feral File becomes aware that a child under 13 has provided Feral File with personally identifiable information, Feral File will remove such information from our files.
