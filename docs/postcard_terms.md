# Autonomy MoMA Postcard Service and Privacy Terms

_Last modified on November 15, 2023._

These Postcard Service and Privacy Terms (these “Terms”) governs your use of and access to the collaborative digital postcard creation and distribution service (“Postcard Service” as described in more detail below) and the associated virtual chat room (“Postcard Service”) provided by Bitmark Inc. (“Bitmark”, “we”, “us”, “our”) through Bitmark’s Autonomy mobile application (the “Application”) to participants in the Postcard Service (“users”, “you”, “your”), and sponsored by The Museum of Modern Art (“MoMA”).  **_These Terms are different from the terms applicable to the use of the Application as a digital wallet, and do not change the terms applicable to such use of the Application._**

Please read these Terms carefully before accessing or using any element of the Postcard Service.  Each time you access or use the Postcard Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree to be bound by these Terms, you should not access or use the Postcard Service. 

If you are acting on behalf of an entity, such as a non-profit organization, incorporated association, corporation, partnership, limited liability company or other entity, "you" refers to the entity, and you represent and warrant that you have power and authority to enter into these Terms on behalf of the entity.

These Terms void where prohibited by law, and the right to access the Postcard Service is revoked in such jurisdictions.

## Postcard Service Basics

The Postcard Service consists of the following features and functions:

* Each participant adds graphic content consisting of a “stamp” and a “signature” to a “Postcard”, receiving an NFT Postcard and receiving a URL to invite another individual to become a participant with respect to the same Postcard.
* Postcards are tracked on a leaderboard by total distance “traveled” from participant to participant.  The leaderboard may be displayed within the Application or on one or more websites or other applications selected by Bitmark in its sole discretion.  The leaderboard is public.
* Participants in a given Postcard can collaborate and communicate in a team chat specific to that Postcard and visible only to those participants.
* The ability to purchase merchandise bearing some or all of the graphic content placed on Postcards including your own and that of other participants (“Merchandise”). 

We may charge you to issue or mint NFT Postcards an amount we determine from time to time in our sole discretion.  


## Personal Information

The provisions of these Terms regarding personal information are supplemental to the standard [Autonomy Privacy Policy](https://github.com/bitmark-inc/autonomy.io/blob/main/apps/docs/privacy.md). The Postcard Service is part of the “Services” for the purposes of the standard Autonomy Privacy Policy and the standard Autonomy Privacy Policy will continue to apply, except to the limited extent these Terms are different regarding the collection and processing of personal information with respect to the Postcard Service.  

* While using the Application as a digital wallet, we collect and/or process a minimal amount of personal information, as indicated in the standard Autonomy Privacy Policy.  Also as indicated in the standard Autonomy Privacy Policy, the Application interfaces with public blockchains, where information is permanently and irrevocably public by design.
  
* The use of the Postcard Service requires that we collect and/or process more personal information than the use of the Application as a digital wallet.  We collect and process the following personal information in order to provide the Postcard Service:

* A “fingerprint” of your device, when you scan the QR code or click on a URL to participate in the Postcard Service.  The “fingerprint” may contain information about your device, such as the IP address, device version and technical specifications, operating system, language, and mobile carrier.   We use this information to ensure that you receive an invitation to participate in the Postcard Service.  We discard this personal information within 1 hour of the initial scan.

* If we charge to issue or mint NFT Postcards, we will collect payment information, which may be your cryptocurrency address, or fiat currency payment information, including your name, address, email address, telephone phone number, and payment card information.  We will use this personal information only to process the payment and communicate with you about the processing of the payment.  To the extent we (and not our payment processor) receive this information, we will retain this information for as long as required by applicable law.

* If you purchase Merchandise, we will collect payment information, which may be your cryptocurrency address, or fiat currency payment information, including your name, address, email address, phone number, and payment card information.  We will also collect shipping information, consisting of your name, address, email address, and phone number. We will use this personal information only to process the payment and ship the Merchandise and to communicate with you about the purchase and shipment (including returns and other customer service communications).  To the extent we (and not our payment processor) receive this information, we will retain this information for as long as required by applicable law.

* If you want to participate in the optional “distance traveled” leaderboard, your device will use its IP address to determine the nearest city or other municipality, which will be encoded in the Postcard’s metadata.  This city or municipality (not the IP address) is included in the metadata of the NFT record for the Postcard, and will be available in the public blockchain.

* If you participate in the team chat:
    * your selected username. 
    * any personal information you may volunteer in the team chat, which will be associated with your username.

    This information is encrypted, and visible only to your Postcard team. We retain this information for 30 days after the first post to the team chat.

* Any personal information you may volunteer in your design for the Postcard. This information will be available through the public blockchain and so is permanently and irrevocably public by design.

In addition to the uses of personal information stated in the standard Autonomy Privacy Policy, we will use the personal information above to provide you with the Postcard Service.  Please note that the elements of the personal information you provide above may be linked to each other in connection with the use of the Postcard Service, but we will not link or correlate this information to other information collected and stored in the Application, our other Services, or collected through our Website. 

We may engage other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and need to share your information with them to provide products or services to you. Unless we tell you differently, our agents and service providers will not have any right to use the Personal Information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us in fulfilling your request.

If you use fiat currency to make a payment to us, the payment information will also be processed and retained by our payment processors (not us) under their privacy policies, which can be found here:  [https://stripe.com/privacy](https://stripe.com/privacy).

## Commissions

The NFT record for each Postcard (“**Postcard NFT**”) will include a smart contract for the public blockchain on which such NFT is minted.  That smart contract:



* will automatically remit to Bitmark a percentage of any payment for a participant’s interest in a NFT Postcard which shall apply to all resales (and subsequent resales) of such interests, in perpetuity; 
* if there is a sponsor associated with the Postcard, automatically remit to the sponsor a percentage of any payment for a participant’s interest in a NFT Postcard which shall apply to all resales (and subsequent resales) of such interests, in perpetuity; and 
* will remit the remainder to the seller of the interest. 

The percentages to be remitted to Bitmark and any sponsor will be disclosed to each participant prior to such participant agreeing to participate in the creation of the relevant Postcard.

## Code of Conduct 

First, and most important, remember that the Postcards are a shared experience shaped by you and your peers. Please be respectful of this community space.

Specifically, in connection with the use of the Postcard Services, you agree that you will not, and will not encourage or assist others to:

* contribute, upload and/or distribute any material which infringes any third party intellectual property, privacy, or publicity rights;
* violate any applicable laws on a local, national, or international level, including without limitation, child pornography, export control, or antidiscrimination laws;


You are responsible for all of your activity in connection with the Postcard Service. Bitmark reserves the right (but not the obligation), in its sole discretion, to determine whether you have violated this Code of Conduct, any other provision of these Terms, or have otherwise violated reasonable expectations for respectful behavior in connection with the Postcard Service, and can remove your Postcard from the leaderboard and/or suspend or deny your access to the Postcard Service in its sole and absolute discretion, without any notice to you.

## Pricing and Purchases

Prices for Merchandise and for issuing NFT Postcards will be stated within Autonomy. All prices are in U.S. dollars. Prices and Merchandise may change at Bitmark's discretion. 

You are responsible for paying any and all applicable sales taxes, use taxes, GST, VAT, customs duties or other taxes or levies associated with your purchase, whether or not we calculate such amounts and add them to the total to be paid for your purchase.

Bitmark does not endorse any user-provided content, and expressly disclaims any and all liability in connection with user-provided content. Bitmark and its designees shall have the right, without prior notice, to remove from Merchandise, or to refuse to sell any Merchandise bearing, any content that is subject to complaint, creates legal risk, or is otherwise objectionable to Bitmark in its sole and unfettered discretion. 

Information regarding Merchandise may contain design or typographical errors or inaccuracies and may not be complete or current. We therefore reserve the right to correct any errors, inaccuracies or omissions and to change or update information regarding Merchandise at any time without prior notice (including after you have submitted your order). Please note that such errors, inaccuracies or omissions may relate to Merchandise design, description, pricing and availability. 

We reserve the right, for any reason in our sole and unfettered discretion, to limit or restrict quantities of Merchandise or refuse or cancel any orders for Merchandise (including after you have submitted your order). We shall have the right to limit, refuse, or cancel any such orders whether or not the order has been confirmed and you have been charged for the sale. If you have already been charged for the purchase and your order is canceled, we shall immediately issue a credit to your credit card account or refund the amount in the manner in which the purchase was made by you. 

## Shipping and Refunds

At checkout, we offer you a range of shipping options to create your own shipping quote. You are responsible for payment of the shipping charges as part of the total payment for your purchase based on the shipping option you select.

The best way to request a Merchandise return is to contact us using the messaging function of Autonomy.  You may also contact us at support@bitmark.com to request a Merchandise return. You must make this request within 30 days of receiving the shipment. Be sure to specify the reason for the return request in your message and indicate any preference for replacement (whether exchanging for an identical product or selecting an alternate style, size or color), or a refund.  Provide an image of the damage or defect if possible.  

Bitmark will provide a prepaid return shipping label in cases where it can confirm that items have arrived in damaged condition or are defective.  For all other cases, return shipping costs are the responsibility of the customer.

Under no circumstance does Bitmark reimburse (or provide credit) for return shipping costs incurred by the customer.  If a product is damaged or defective, you must make arrangements with Bitmark support to confirm acceptance and handling of the return before shipping the product to Bitmark.

## Warranty Disclaimer

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE POSTCARD SERVICE, CONTENT, MERCHANDISE, AND ANY OTHER PRODUCTS OR SERVICES PROVIDED BY BITMARK OR MOMA ARE PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, OR THAT USE OF THE POSTCARD SERVICE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE. WITHOUT LIMITING THE GENERALITY OF THE FOREGOING, NEITHER BITMARK NOR MOMA  MAKES ANY WARRANTY THAT THE QUALITY OF ANY MERCHANDISE PURCHASED BY YOU WILL MEET YOUR EXPECTATIONS,

## Indemnity

You will indemnify and hold Bitmark and MoMA, and each of their respective  parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, and employees harmless (including, without limitation, from all damages, liabilities, settlements, costs and attorneys' fees) from any claim or demand made by any third party or any dispute between you and a third party due to or arising out of your access to the Postcard Service, use of the Postcard Service, your violation of these Terms, or the infringement by you or any third party using your account of any intellectual property or other right of any person or entity.

## Limitation of Liability

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL BITMARK OR MOMA, OR THEIR RESPECTIVE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, OR AGENTS BE LIABLE WITH RESPECT TO THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THESE TERMS UNDER ANY CONTRACT, NEGLIGENCE, TORT, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY (I) FOR ANY AMOUNT IN THE AGGREGATE IN EXCESS OF THE GREATER OF US$50 OR THE AMOUNT YOU HAVE PAID FOR THE MERCHANDISE OR SERVICE GIVING RISE TO LIABILITY; (II) FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND WHATSOEVER; (III) FOR DATA LOSS OR COST OF PROCUREMENT OF ANY SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES; OR (IV) FOR ANY MATTER BEYOND BITMARK 'S REASONABLE CONTROL. 

## Other Terms

_Termination_. These Terms shall remain in full force and effect while you use the Postcard Service, and perpetually as to any Postcards you create and distribute. You may terminate your use of the Postcard Services at any time by ceasing to participate in the Postcard Services, and securely deleting your NFT records associated with your Postcards. Bitmark may terminate or suspend your access to the Postcard Service at any time, for any reason, and without warning, which may result in the forfeiture and destruction of all information associated with your account. Bitmark may also terminate or suspend any and all elements of the Postcard Service and/or your access to the Postcard Service, without prior notice or liability, if you breach any of the terms or conditions of these Terms. Upon termination of your access to the Postcard Service, your right to access the Postcard Service will immediately cease. All provisions of these Terms that, by their nature, should survive termination, shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, and limitations of liability.

_Persons Under 18; Your Right to Enter into a Contract_. Bitmark does not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the older of the age of 18 or the age of majority in their jurisdiction (“Minimum Age”) or knowingly allow such persons to register for the Postcard Service. If you are under the Minimum Age, please do not attempt to register for the Postcard Service or send any information about yourself to us. If we learn that we have collected personal information from a person under the Minimum Age without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. 

_Miscellaneous_. The failure of either party to exercise, in any respect, any right provided for herein shall not be deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder. Neither Bitmark nor MoMA shall not be liable for any failure to perform its obligations hereunder where such failure results from any cause beyond Bitmark’s reasonable control.  If any provision of these Terms is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that these Terms shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable. These Terms are not assignable, transferable or sublicensable by you except with Bitmark’s prior written consent. Bitmark may transfer, assign or delegate these Terms and their rights and obligations without consent. Both parties agree that these Terms are the complete and exclusive statement of the mutual understanding of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes and cancels all previous written and oral agreements, communications and other understandings relating to the subject matter hereof, and that all modifications must be in a writing signed by both parties, except as otherwise provided herein. No agency, partnership, joint venture, or employment is created as a result of these Terms and you do not have any authority of any kind to bind Bitmark or MoMA in any respect whatsoever. MoMA is an intended third party beneficiary of these Terms; there are no other third party beneficiaries to these Terms. Headings for each section have been included above for your convenience, but such headings do not have any legal meaning, and may not accurately reflect the content of the provisions they precede.

_Governing Law; Jurisdiction_. These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Wyoming without regard to the conflict of laws provisions thereof. Any dispute arising from or relating to the subject matter of these Terms shall be finally settled in the state or federal courts in Cheyenne, Wyoming, and the parties consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue therein; provided that with respect to circumstances requiring temporary or preliminary injunctive relief to prevent harm to Bitmark or MoMA, Bitmark or MoMA may seek such relief in any court with jurisdiction over the parties.
