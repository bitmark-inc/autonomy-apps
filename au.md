### Au: What does rebellion mean to you as an artist?

Reeps One:
Rebellion to me means that you cannot settle down. You are always ill at ease, ready to go in the opposite direction or to be a failure. For many people rebellion is some kind of privileged condition and some even think that it puts them in a position of superiority when it comes to taking action. I think rebellion is the minimum state of mind a human can have.

### Is it important to try those things that you might not be very good at?

I think it’s important just to do anything. You think you know but you don’t, so by making these little gestures, you find out who you are.
