**Announcement**

Dear Autonomy user,

We regret to inform you that effective immediately, our customer support team will no longer be able to assist with issues related to devices running versions prior to Android 9 and iOS 15.

We understand the inconvenience of having to update your device's operating system, but in order to continue using the latest version of Autonomy to its full potential and receive ongoing customer support, we strongly recommend updating to the latest version of either iOS or Android. You can check for updates in your device's settings and follow the prompts to install them. Thank you for your continued support.

Sincerely, The Bitmark Development Team
