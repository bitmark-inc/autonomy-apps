    "description": "The collaboration between the Gee’s Bend quilters and artist Anna Lucia communicates a rich set of themes and histories, connecting algorithmic computation with the recombinative processes of quilt making. “Generations” has led me to consider the storied history of textiles, computing, decorative arts and gender, themes that feature across several of Anna’s artworks. Anna specifically looked at the work of Gee’s Bend quilters Louisiana P. Bendolph, Loretta Pettway Bennett, Essie Bendolph Pettway, and Lucy T. Pettway (deceased), who was represented by her daughter and quilter Mary Margaret Pettway.\n\nCraft (decorative metal work) is an important part of my own art practice, and having considered how motif and rhythm relate to generative abstraction, the artworks made by Gee’s Bend quilters speak to me strongly on a personal level.\n\nReleased in May 2023 through Arsnl Art, I believe “Generations” is aptly titled; not only a reminder that generative processes abound in the decorative arts, but of the capacity for craft (whether code or quilts) to act as a focal point for social activity, as well as cultural expression and preservation.\n\n— 0xDEAFBEEF",

    "description": "Data-driven models including LLMs, GANs, and voice models are generative systems, and in my opinion their societal implications dwarf those of purely procedural generative art. Despite that, much of AI art is made with uncritical enthusiasm, often from a place of power over or detachment from the source of the employed data sets. At the same time, perhaps unsurprisingly, AI art is often met with reactions of fear, anger, or defeat.\n\nAmid these extremes, Holly+ stands out to me as a prescient, relevant, and nuanced statement on the issues of AI models and artist rights, a subject that Holly Herndon and Mat Dryhurst have been deeply considering for many years. Holly+ was released independently in collaboration with <a href=\"https://heardsounds.com/\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\">Never Before Heard Sounds</a> in April 2022, notably predating the AI art boom in fall of 2022. \n\nIn a moment of synchronicity, at the very instant I was first experimenting with the Holly+ voice model in 2021, I received a message out of the blue from Holly Herndon inviting me to participate in its use for shared creative expression. Foremost, I find Holly+ inspiring as act of courage: there is vulnerability in publishing something as central to one’s identity as one’s voice. Then there’s the confidence in asserting boundaries by presenting a radical vision of decentralized administration, pursuing a practical solution to balance the inevitable use of such tools with artist rights and compensation.\n\n— 0xDEAFBEEF",

    "description": "“Terraforms” is a dynamically generated on-chain world of virtual land parcels whose structure and interactions are stored and mediated entirely by Ethereum, a programmable blockchain. The ASCII/Unicode character aesthetics recall games like Rogue and Dwarf Fortress, foundational games in direct lineage to communal world-building games like Minecraft. But I believe aesthetics are secondary to the ambitious use of a new computing paradigm for a networked artwork of “lego block” components in “Terraforms,” released independently by anonymous duo Mathcastles in December 2021.\n\nEthereum itself was inspired by the desire of its founder for game primitives to persist outside of centralized control. Smart contracts can be thought of as a type of digital primitive: autonomous, extendable, composable. Looking to this promise, Terraforms land parcels are skeletal abstractions encouraging remixing and re-interpretation through meaning making social activities of the active community around it.\n\nThe success of gen art paired with blockchain, imho, is due in large part to the capacity for online communities to develop around the works. A programmable blockchain is a common reference point for participants, a “gameboard” in a sense, to be used as a proxy for social interaction.\n\n— 0xDEAFBEEF",

    "description": "“Boys of Summer” is a dynamically generated PFP NFT collection and browser-based simulation game that makes a poignant social critique of the overshadowing of our lives by metrics and optimization, reducing human existence to commodified, quantifiable data. It was released in August 2023 through Wild.xyz.\n\nGenerative art and games share common ground, and at least for me, a personal history. My first encounter with generativity in computing was as a child through the procedurally generated dungeon levels, simulation, and emergent gameplay of Roguelike games. It was such a formative experience to inspire a passion for creative computing.\n\nSimulation games are interactive dynamic systems. A gen artist exploring a parameter space or a player exploring a game world share a common intrinsic motivation for discovery. This seems an ideal state for receptive contemplation of complex ideas, speaking to the potential of games as an art medium. Many, including myself, have had such an experience playing “Boys of Summer.” Themes and concepts of the work are not simply communicated but instead discovered and experienced emotionally through reflection of our own in-game decisions.\n\n— 0xDEAFBEEF",

    "description": "With the recent attention that’s come to generative art, algorithmic code has taken center stage. Yet it’s also important to remember generative art’s long-standing connections to video art, op art, cybernetics, and physical processes employing continuous time analog signals. Time as a continuous dimension allows for feedback loops; a fecund method for generating rich and unpredictable aesthetic results. “Temporale” connects to these historical roots, considers time thematically, and showcases the interconnectedness of systems of all sorts: digital, electronic, optical.\n\nIt’s fitting that Temporale was released on the pioneering crypto-art platform SuperRare in April 2023. Sarah Zucker was an early participant in the cryptoart scene, and a confident and vocal supporter of inclusive and sustainable values for a new artist economy. Among her many talents, she is a gifted communicator and I personally have benefited greatly from Sarah’s writing and speaking about art and the NFT ecosystem.\n\nTime is such an important theme both in generative art and in the hyperspeed of crypto and social networks. To borrow an expression from her artistic medium (time-based analog systems), Sarah’s voice and artwork provide a strong signal in an often noisy environment.\n\n— 0xDEAFBEEF",

    "description": "Fastcashmoneyplus.biz was my first encounter with Steve Pikelny’s artwork and it gave me a reassuring feeling. Until that point I was feeling quite unbalanced with my recent discovery of the mania surrounding crypto, NFTs, and generative art. It was comforting to meet an artist acknowledging the absurdity through satire.\n\n“Instructions for Defacement” is a clever use of the form, highlighting the connection between generative and conceptual art (Sol Lewitt, Fluxus event scores) and early computer plotter art. A key question raised by generative art is that of authorship and agency: who is responsible for the art? The artist or the machine? Here that question is playfully and elegantly reframed as one of legal responsibility in the defacement of currency.\n\n“Instructions for Defacement”, released on <a href=\"https://www.plottables.io/\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\">Plottables.io</a> in November 2022, continues Steve‘s cohesive body of work that is clever and subversive, poking at crypto culture and its accepted conventions in an entertaining and thought-provoking manner.\n\n— 0xDEAFBEEF",

    "description": "The 2021 mania for generative art and NFTs gave opportunities to artists from nontraditional backgrounds, from outside art institutions, and from diverse geographic locations to participate in an art economy. “Heaven Computer,” released independently by pseudonymous Brazilian artist Godmin without the support of any platform or team, stands out to me as a unique and unconventional work, exemplary of the promise of diverse expression through decentralization and self-sovereignty. It’s hard to imagine any platform at the time supporting the unique vaporwave-themed minting experience Godmin personally crafted.\n\nBut beyond retro nostalgia is a gateway to deeper themes. The interplay between religious symbolism, operating systems, and randomness stood out to me because of to my own fascination with outsider artist Terry Davis’ <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TempleOS\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\">TempleOS</a>.“Heaven Computer” and Godmin’s later work, “God Observer,” both consider the link between divination and the randomness inherent in generative systems.\n\nWhile rarity and emergence in generative art is often uncritically described in near religious terms, Godmin makes that connection explicit and intentional, showing a playful awareness of the human inclination to perceive meaning in randomness, and how it has inspired (or been manipulated to inspire) awe since ancient times.\n\n— 0xDEAFBEEF",

    "description": "For me, the most fascinating thing about the unexpected and elegant “horizon(te)s” project between Iskra Velitchkova and Zach Lieberman is the nature of the collaboration and the confusion around it. Iskra wrote code to reflect Zach’s visual ideas and vice versa. Some visual work generated through their shared code feels like Zach and some feels like Iskra, but the code that generates those images was often written by the other artist. This is a beautiful and generous idea. The two met regularly during the process of creating the work and the conversations didn’t revolve around technique. They got to know each other, and then expressed themselves through code. The final artwork contains many ideas, a multitude of visual systems that express themselves clearly.\n\nThe original artwork description clarifies the intent: “This framework allowed for speculation, ambiguity, and time to reflect on our own voice and the voice of our collaborator. The idea was not to mimic styles but rather use this framework to try to have a conversation and explore what we see in each other’s work.”\n\nIn general, generative art is collaborative at its core. Everyone writes code on top of other people’s libraries — very few artists start from scratch. On top of that, artists frequently work together to complement each other. Zach has many long-term collaborators including Molmol Kuo and earlier with Golan Levin. Iskra is creating incredible projects with Marcelo Soria-Rodríguez. The fresh part of this collaboration is the lack of familiarity between the artists at the start and the wide range of diverse images produced by the “horizon(te)s” code. The visible “horizon” in each image is the single element that binds them together.\n\n“horizon(te)s” was released on fx(hash) in July 2022. It was a strong statement for these two artists to work together on the release. fx(hash) was a leader in advocating for collaborations like this and having the tools to make it possible.\n\n— Casey REAS",

    "description": "Internet culture is fascinating because of its breadth and depth. There’s a lot of everything for everyone. In her own words, Maya has explored “dominant narratives around femininity, authenticity, and the performance of self online” for years by making work for and about culture on TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube. In “Fake It Till You Make It” (FITYMI) she digs deep into the subculture of wellness, self care graphics, and text on Instagram. FITYMI is a collage of text fragments, symbols, and colors that were directly sourced from existing materials. Maya selected these elements carefully by hand. Her reassembly of these elements through her code mimics the cheerful tone of the source materials while enhancing the feeling of cliche and absurdity.\n\nIn total, her text system includes 250 phrase structures as well as lists including 145 nouns, 194 adjectives, 213 adverbs, and more. She calculates the total possibilities as over 80 billion, which means the 1000 in the official FITYMI series is a tiny subset of what was possible. I think everyone has their favorites in the FITYMI series and mine include “STOP BEING GENUINE TO BE TOXIC” with a graphic of a winking flower and “HEY GIRL, FEELING IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN EGO.”\n\nIn placing this work back on Instagram through her daily\n“fake_it_till_you_make_it_lol” account, Maya is in dialogue with her original source material. While the work feels like it fits on Instagram, it was completely unique within the space of generative art when it was released on Art Blocks in August 2022. The embedded themes and approach to generative art expanded what many people thought was possible.\n\n— Casey REAS",

    "description": "In describing his work, qubibi (Kazumasa Teshigawara) said, “Ultimately, the output is the process itself. That’s what makes my art mine.” This is a unique and special thing about qubibi’s work “Mimizu.” Unlike many other generative art projects, Mimizu has been released continuously for over two years now, all using the same code base. It’s a longitudinal release of work where the more there is, the more fascinating the work becomes. The origin of “Mimizu” are present in qubibi’s “<a href=\"https://vimeo.com/243842004\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\">hello world (2017/2010) short version</a>” video from 2017. It reveals more about the work than the still images of “Mimizu” do on their own.\n\n“Mimizu” was released on Hic et Nunc, an NFT platform that expanded rapidly in early 2021. The unique thing about Hic et Nunc (HEN) (Latin for “Here and Now”) was the ease and autonomy in releasing work. Artists were able to post their own work and to make their own decisions about the edition sizes and pricing. The design of HEN as a decentralized system allowed artists to release work in a new way and for collectors to support those artists in a new way as well. Tensions between the founder of HEN and others led to it collapsing, but the Teia community rose from the ashes. While the final “Mimizu” in the original series were released through Teia in 2022, other works in the larger series have been released in other exhibition spaces, both online and in brick-and-mortar galleries.\n\nWhen I first saw “Mimizu” coming through the Hic et Nunc feed in early 2021, I was immediately drawn to it. I didn’t have any context. What was it? Who created it? In an interview, qubibi described a film by Dušan Makavejev as a blend of the “sublime and the grotesque” which I feel is also an apt description of his own “Mimizo.” I couldn’t say it any better. It feels dark, elegant, and beautiful at the same time — looking deeper is always rewarded with this work.\n\n— Casey REAS",

    "description": "Artists working within different communities have started to overlap more in the last few years, releasing work on new digital art platforms side-by-side. The merging of poets and writers with visual artists has been one of the most exciting outcomes. This is in parallel with writers standing on their own as another kind of artist. One of the earliest exhibitions that featured the synthesis of art and computers, the Cybernetic Serendipity exhibition at the ICA in London in 1968 featured poets, sculptors, writers, musicians, engineers, scientists, and wild hybrids. This early wide focus feels like it closed for a long time, but is now coming back.\n\nThis brings us to the extraordinary and ambitious “1 the Road” project created in 2017 by Ross Goodwin. The name “1 the Road” is a reference to Jack Keroac’s On the Road, the iconic novel written continuously with a typewriter and a single roll of paper. Like the main characters in On the Road, Goodwin and collaborators drove across the United States. Unlike the characters in the original novel, Goodwin wrote software that composed text as he drove based on what the software “saw” through a camera mounted to the exterior of the car, as well as a microphone and gps data. The result is a book, written through machine learning algorithms, in the style defined through training texts selected by Ross.\n\nEven though the 2017 version of “1 the Road” doesn’t involve blockchains or non-fungible tokens, we felt it was important to include some artworks created outside of these new ecosystems within SOURCE. Artists working within the realm of generative art and software continue to make work independently from the changes of the last few years. We feel the future of digital art is both on- and off-chain.\n\n— Casey REAS",

    "description": "At the moment, there are 273 “Pixel Rugs” in the world. Tomorrow, there will probably be 274. Travess Smalley works on them in fits and spurts — he goes through periods where he releases one each day in small editions that have varied from 5 to 10 over the years. When an unexplored idea strikes, he releases new rugs until the changes feel less exciting. The work will sit untouched, until eventually the next evolution of the work will clarify and the cycle repeats.\n\nThe first “Pixel Rugs” were released on Hic Et Nunc in Spring 2021, a period of time where artists released and collected each others’ work there with high energy. Today, the “Pixel Rugs” continue as an ongoing project, different from long-form generative art that’s minted from the same source code. Travess continues to tinker and modify his process. He’s also not using a single tool, he chains together a sequence of algorithms and software tools in a way that makes the “Pixel Rugs” entirely original expressions.\n\nAs an artist from Appalachia, Travess is influenced by geometric abstraction in Appalachian textiles and quilting. As a software enthusiast, he’s also influenced by 8-bit video game backgrounds and textures. The two realms merge in “Pixel Rugs.” The video game roots are best seen by looking at the work magnified. Zoomed out, the rugs feel like woven textiles, but when seens up close, the low-resolution quality and minimal color palette is revealed. The “Pixel Rugs” are a balance of chaos and craft.\n\nTravess has collaborated with craftspeople to create physical, hand-knotted wool rugs. He exhibited these at Foxy Production in New York in Spring of 2023.\n\n— Casey REAS",

    "description": "The iconic feature of Emily Xie’s work is the intricate, crafted textures created with code. With the same code, she cuts these textures into graphic shapes and collages them into complex compositions. She’s best known for her “Memories of Qilin” release on Art Blocks in March of 2022, but she has released series after series of engaging work over the last few years. “Off Script” was a part of the London exhibition with Bright Moments in Summer 2022.\n\n“Off Script” is a long-form generative art series that includes one hundred individual works, all created from the same source code. I think the best way to appreciate this type of work is to look at all 100 together and recognize what is unique and coherent across the series. Along with her detailed textures, Emily is excellent at working with color and composition. In “Off Script,” the elegant, but imperfect shapes that feel hand-made capture my interest. My attention is fixed on the way the shapes and colors collide and overlap. Each of the 100 in the series feels like its own world, and the series as a whole like a universe of ideas.\n\nEmily is interested in sensation and tactility within her images. In writing about “Off Script,” she explains, “With its synesthetic qualities, the series challenges its own medium, creating a dialogue between the immateriality of digital representation and the corporality of the physical realm.”\n\n— Casey REAS",

She is interested in how disparate materials and patterns come together to create unified visuals, and the stories that each might bring into the fold. She draws inspiration from physical media such as textiles, collage, and wallpaper, and examines them within a digital context.\n\nHer generative systems often navigate many delicate balances at once: the interplays between chance versus control, the organic versus the systematic, and the abstract versus the representational.\n\nXie's creative coding work is collected and shown internationally. Recently, she has exhibited at Singapore Art Week, Kunsthalle Zürich, Unit London, the Armory Show, Bright Moments, Times Square, the StandardVision Artist Showcase throughout the city of Los Angeles.\n\nPrior to pursuing art full-time, Emily built a career as a software engineer while exploring and teaching herself creative coding on the side.",

    "description": "Siebren Versteeg works with code to create hybrid photo collages and simulated paintings. He pulls photographs in directly from online sources and adds contextual brushstrokes to augment the photos. When I first saw his work installed at the bitforms gallery in New York in 2019, I didn’t know what I was looking at. On the surface, the work reminded me of Robert Rauschenberg’s paintings from the 1960s that integrated transferred images from newspapers with painted brushstrokes, but Siebren was and is clearly doing his own thing. Siebren has been developing this work for years prior to when I first saw it; the work is refined and focused. The “live” quality is essential to the work, it’s always changing, always painting and bringing in new images to keep the work in the moment. It’s a mirror held up to the media circus.\n\nIn “For a Limited Time,” released through ARSNL in March 2023, Siebren has created a twist on this prior work. Like the work before, realtime images from the news flow in, the images are cut and collaged, and brushstrokes are added. “For a Limited Time” introduces the idea that although images are being continuously created, only some will be saved. Over one year, around 35,000 images will be created by Versteeg’s algorithms, but only 750 can survive. Multiple times each hour, new images are scraped from trending stories on the internet and are augmented through Siebren’s code. These images are available for a few hours when they can be “claimed.” If they aren’t claimed, they are no longer available. Right now 346 canvases have been claimed and 404 remain. Everything will end in March 2024. It’s a one-year performance and experiment. I think this work raises interesting questions about attention, spectacle, and value. I visit the stream of generated images a few times a week, looking to see how the news is reflected there. Right now, there’s a focus on tennis in New York, cancer screenings, and the coronavirus. Who knows how the work will shift tomorrow, as the world turns?\n\n— Casey REAS",

    "description": "Each of the 512+1 “specimens” released within the “Mutant Garden Seeder” series has a name and a probability to mutate. Tonda has mutated 617 times; Edyra has mutated 6 times; Lyne has only mutated once. Abirey was born on block 12884205 and has a 14% chance that it will mutate each month. In this case, to “mutate” means to change how the artwork looks. Within the frame of the larger history of visual art, this is a radical proposition that Harm van den Dorpel has created. At any moment, the way the art looks might be different from the moment before. Where does this leave the viewer, the collector? \n\nWhen “Mutant Garden Seeder” was released in 2021 with Folia, a Berlin-based online gallery, most people didn’t know what to think of it. Harm’s vision, however, was clear, and two years later this artwork has become an iconic example of how code and blockchains allow for new ideas to flow into the visual arts. In describing the project, Harm wrote, “In this blockchain-native work, I aim to show that with the advent of immutability we do not need to sacrifice the fluid and transformative potential of digital artifacts.”\n\n— Casey REAS",

    "description": "It's exhausting to be a full time artist. DADAGAN doesn’t have to sleep. Operator does. DADAGAN doesn’t need to concern itself with the things Ania and I do. It doesn’t need to fix its posture, worry about its eyes slowly deteriorating from blue light, doesn’t have marital obligations or romance, doesn’t need time to marinate on concepts, stop to eat, get a haircut before its engagements, fly to its talk, nor practice any level of selfcare. DADAGAN brings to mind Jonathan Crary’s 24/7: <i>Late Capitalism and the End of Sleep</i>. I used to think I could steal time and just sleep less, but there’s no such thing as stealing time. As artists, we resort to optimizing through thoughtfully architected studio structures, an ecosystem of supporters, and gallery relationships to write press releases, document our work, create a diligent archive, communicate the work, build relationships, prep content, write captions for Twitter and Instagram, meet with curators, do written interviews, go-to-market strategy meetings, create catalogs, speak to commissioners, do financial planning, cost out the next work, and after all that, we still have to protect energy to make art. On the contrary, DADAGAN is already optimized to be a market dreamboat of a sleepless artist without any of the earthly consequences human artists experience.\n\nDADAGAN is a conceptual artwork that employs generative systems to be a successful NFT artist bot while sidestepping problems of 24/7 capitalism and the impact that has on the sustainability of an artist. These generative systems not only create the art, but also the artist’s persona, and are now being automated to sell art through Tweets and even provide aftercare to collectors.\n\nIt has been said that Andy Warhol’s greatest work is Andy Warhol. Rather than looking solely at DADAGAN’s artistic output, I’m fascinated with the artist bot itself, as an absurd mimesis and performance illustrating what both traditional and speculative NFT markets demand of artists for just the slim chance of making a living from their art. What takes the hyperbole off the register is who created DADAGAN: <a href=\"https://dada.art/home\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\">DADA</a>. As Judy Mam from DADA says, “DADAGAN does what DADA would never do.”\n\nIn the summer of 2019, KnownOrigin held their first festival, IDAF, in the basement of an old building in the center of Manchester UK. This was where Ania and I first met Judy Mam and Beatriz Ramos, the co-founders of DADA. Beatriz Ramos presented DADA, a collaborative platform where artists have conversations through drawing, and an ecosystem focused on intrinsic values where artists can live and create without market pressure. She went on to explain a blockchain innovation many of us now know very well, but then it was novel. In 2017, DADA modified the CryptoPunks ERC20 smart contract, implementing automatic on-chain artist royalties into their <a href=\"https://nft.dada.art/info\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\">Creeps & Weirdos</a> collection—this is the first known instance of a platform inscribing royalties on-chain. The presentation continued with the framework behind the “<a href=\"https://powerdada.medium.com/the-invisible-economy-db46897d4f07\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\">Invisible Economy</a>” paper (2020), co-authored by Ramos and Mam, which proposes the “radical separation of art and the market.” One slide highlighted that market dynamics ultimately lead to 98% of artists quitting. I took a photo of this slide. I felt it, the burnout. I remember at the time Ania and I had just opened our first museum exhibition, and we thought we had no choice but to quit. Our earliest interactions were already hinting at the impossibility of the system.\n\nThe absurdity of DADA being behind DADAGAN seems like a Fluxus strategy of “performing the system” that Maciunas himself could not have imagined possible. Mari Dumett, author of <i>Corporate Imaginations: Fluxus Strategies for Living</i>, describes this strategy as “mimesis of the advanced capitalist system” which entails “appropriating tools, occupying spaces, and exposing operations of the system evinced a historically specific understanding of the possibilities (and impossibilities) for critical art practice…”\n\nDADAGAN makes me ask: In what ways are we performing the system ourselves? Am I an artist or a bot?\n\n— Dejha Ti, Operator",

    "description": "“Most Accidents Happen at Home” is a highly original portrait of a moment in Jonas Lund’s life. What we see are images depicting a range of items you might find in any household, all stacked impossibly on top of each other. These generative stacks float in a variety of background colors that come straight from an aspirational home furnishings company or lifestyle brand. The minimalism, the pastels, the shiny objects remind us that we’re all just one purchase away from domestic bliss. As pleasant as they are, there is a subtle uneasiness I feel when looking at these arrangements: The precarity is difficult to ignore. Balance is hanging by a thread. By now I could either be talking about Jonas’ collection or the lives of most people I know in their 30s and 40s.\n\nHere’s how it works: every time Jonas drops something in his actual home, an object tower in one of these artworks falls in an on-chain event. Jonas then shares an image of the accident. He claims — with a level of seriousness that is debatable, knowing his sense of humor — that this work is a hyperbolic form of self-accountability aimed at helping him stop dropping things at home. When I first read about “Most Accidents Happen at Home,” which was released on Wild.XYZ in 2023, I enjoyed the way that Jonas was experimenting with how something happening in the physical world (in this case, his home) could be reflected in the digital world. I also appreciated the sense of vulnerability the collection offers: the artist’s persona is cracked. We will know when Jonas spills his soup at home.\n\nThe conceptual choice in art direction was clearly taking a punch at the Instagrammable living rooms and kitchens to which we’re aggressively socialized to aspire. However, it wasn’t until I learned (from a Twitter Spaces no less) that Jonas was expecting his first child, that I felt I could really grasp the work. As silly and “Jonas Lund” as it is, “Most Accidents Happen at Home” also feels like a very human way of expressing the intense emotions that might flood someone about to bring a child into the world — the elation and excitement, but also the anxiety and worry about your surroundings. The collection then registered to me as a manifestation of Jonas’ desire to be more careful in the domestic sphere because of his incoming child, and it felt more tender to me than at first glance. Maybe I’m wrong and it’s just cheeky, but maybe not.\n\n— Ania Catherine, Operator",

    "description": "Full transparency: our “Good Morning“ is dead.\n\nI think an effective system leaves traces of itself behind even after it’s gone. If you’ve encountered one, you will have an answer to the question: what did it set in motion?\n\nCreated on the occasion of Vellum LA x EPOCH’s exhibition Lifelike in 2023, Lauren McCarthy’s “Good Morning” invites the collector into a relationship of sorts. Every relationship has requirements that must be met in order for it to stay alive. In this case, a simple daily “hello” does the trick, which is done by opening the browser window (which is, in a way, acknowledging the artwork’s existence). If you don’t open it for more than 24 hours, it dies. For the short time my “Good Morning” was alive, it was simply another daily task. But when it died, I was surprisingly sad. I wasn’t mourning the pink “Good Morning” graphic, but the fact that I wasn’t grounded in a routine enough to manage  simply opening a browser window once a day — it was like garden-neglect with Miracle Grow.\n\nWith Lauren’s deeply reflective, conceptual, personal, and sophisticated practice, she often asks the public to confront themselves and their relationships with others, sometimes mediated or impacted by technology. With this work, how the very meanings of words like “responsibility” and “ownership” are changing through blockchain are also being unveiled. The death of my “Good Morning” oddly became an event I return to randomly, which always reminds me to look around and ask myself: what else in my life (health, marriage, relationships with family and friends, plants) is being neglected? Is it possible I’ll wake up one day to find that suddenly they’ve vanished as well? It’s possible. This seemingly simple artwork created a dynamic between me, an image, and the artist that demonstrates the power of a system to linger beyond one’s encounter with it and touch on the most intimate, personal aspects of our lives.\n\n— Ania Catherine, Operator",

    "description": "“Appropriate Response,” created by Mario Klingemann in 2020, without a platform nor blockchain (a good reminder that generative art requires neither) struck me immediately for a few reasons. First, my love for aphorisms and the power of text fragments that, devoid (by design) of more context, construct a universe around them in collaboration with the reader. I can imagine that the way “Appropriate Response” is designed to be a one-statement-per-viewer makes this uniquely individualized universe particularly potent.\n\nThe second thing that struck me was the choice of having these statements, created through a custom GPT2 model shown on the antiquated format of split-flap display. The tactile delivery holds the viewer in the future and past simultaneously. Encountering this signage transports you instantly to train stations one might encounter on vintage photography postcards. While the split-flap display is typically used in such settings to tell you where to go, Klingemann’s conceptual use in “Appropriate Response“ hints at where we might be heading. The wind, the sound of the words formulating themselves, their coming together through small flapping rectangles, all profoundly shape how they’re received.\n\nThird, the choreography of the viewer via the kneeling mechanism: Generative text meets religious furniture in “Appropriate Response.” The loaded memories (mental and physical) and emotions tied to the act of kneeling cannot be underestimated. It is brilliant how Klingemann incorporates the physical position of the audience member into the experience, knowing that it would change the way they received the statement.\n\nBut the waiting for the text might be my favorite part. In an age of instant everything, the moments of time suspended, when all you can do is wait for the text to arrive, are a gift. Generative text is the beginning of this work, not the end, which in my opinion is why this is so strong and why it excites me tremendously. It’s experiential art with a generative component. Good art gives you what you didn’t know would please you.\n\n— Ania Catherine, Operator",

    "description": "There is something intriguing to me about producing artwork that looks, feels, and appears to be the complete opposite of digital, challenging preconceptions about how art created with code is expected to look. It’s something that demonstrates both expertise and also a love for code so deep that one can push its limits, discover its unexpected possibilities, and revel in its ability to surprise.\n\nMelissa Wiederrecht is an artist, computer scientist, and expert in generative surface pattern design. I remember the first time I encountered a “Sudfah,” having no idea how it was made and no idea it was generative — all I knew was that I wanted to dive deep into its liquid curves and colors. Each calligraphic line becomes its own story and interacts differently while bleeding into rich pinks, greens, blues, and ambers. The way Melissa created the illusion of various levels of moisture in the spill puddles is remarkable. There’s a curious sense of peace in each output.\n\n“Sudfah” (Arabic for happy accident) was released on Art Blocks in June 2022. It comes from Wiederrecht’s multi-year endeavor to perfect a “good ink bleed with code,” her interest in Islamic art and calligraphy, and her  intention of reminding us to find the surprising beauty in mistakes. It feels like this collection flowed straight out of her. It demonstrates a mastery of code, but channeled in a deeply personal direction. “Sudfah” is a breath of fresh air in long-form generative art and certainly a favorite collection of mine.\n\n— Ania Catherine, Operator",

    "description": "Sasha Stiles’ contribution to the 21st century’s understanding of and discourse around generative poetry — and the relationship between human, machine, language, and art — is already widely recognized, but I imagine it will only be truly grasped in the coming decades. Created independently in 2018, Technelegy is Sasha’s AI poetry alter ego, an emergent transhuman poet that has established its own voice — one trained on Stiles’ writing and selected references. Through and in collaboration with Technelegy, Sasha asks, <i>what does it mean to be human in a nearly post-human era</i>? The name itself, which includes the word elegy, signifies that Sasha’s relationship with technology is sober. It recognizes that a technical capacity gained might mean something else is lost.\n\nIn a positively confusing way, Technelegy’s words feel located, embodied, as though they are stemming from someone with a fully formed consciousness who has experienced life’s chapters and textures. This may be due to Technelegy’s way of reflecting on its own unique position, with an impressive amount of technical knowledge coupled with insecurity, as well as an awareness of gaps of information and flaws. With that said, when Sasha writes collaboratively with it, you can also feel the difference between her words and those by Technelegy. Those collaborations are particularly interesting as they enable your mind to identify patterns that might hint towards one or the other. The questions Technelegy poses, and observations it makes, feel profoundly human (much more so than those from ChatGPT for example). I feel closest to Technelegy as a being when it wonders. Which, returning back to Sasha’s question about what it means to be human, might point us in a fruitful direction. Maybe that is what sets us apart from machines: not knowing, but having curiosity and the desire to ask questions, not just answer them.\n\n— Ania Catherine, Operator",

    "description": "“A system requires gentle support and maintenance.” — Lifeform #2\n\n“Lifeforms” as a work of generative art brings up many questions that have only become more relevant since its independent release in 2021. Sarah Friend is an artist and software engineer who has a conceptually rigorous, highly technical yet uniquely warm practice. At the time of the release of “Lifeforms,” NFTs were exploding financially, everyone was diving in, sales and speculation were at a peak, the song <i>digital ownership of digital art and money for everyone</i> was on the loudspeaker. Sarah walked into the room through a door everyone else either didn’t see or didn’t bother to open. While the majority of people at that time were focused on financial and artistic innovation with blockchain, the introduction of digital ownership and scarcity, and the potential of generative systems and blockchain to enable create new forms of creation and monetization, Sarah created “Lifeforms,” which counters completely the dominant logic of the moment. Upon receiving a “Lifeform,” you must give it away within 90 days. It will bring you no financial gain whatsoever. You will only have the satisfaction of being part of extending its life, allowing it to continue. “Lifeforms” is a conceptual artwork, an experiment in care as a collaborative exercise, and a mirror showing how much we value that which does nothing for us. Its lifespan depends on a system created by Sarah, between “Lifeforms,” and the people whose wallets they inhabit. We all survive through systems, yet rarely ask the pertinent question: what do systems need in order to survive?\n\n“Lifeforms” for me is situated in the lineage of Mierle Laderman Ukeles’ work MANIFESTO FOR MAINTENANCE ART 1969! which highlights the importance of maintenance. She emphasizes that while maintenance is not as exciting and sexy as innovation, it is arguably more important. Without maintenance, what is the fate of everything we build? Without being able to think about responsibility beyond ownership, who is going to care about the system, and beyond that, who is going to care about the people who care? I love that Sarah brings questions of care, ownership, maintenance of life, and responsibility to generative art. “Lifeforms” — exhibited on iPhone displays—have a small physical footprint but the implications of this concept and commentary reach well beyond our tiny screens.\n\n— Ania Catherine, Operator",

    "description": "The primary example for the definition of generative is “the female reproductive system and its generative cycles.” Primavera De Filippi’s “Plantoid” takes the form of a physical sculpture. It is a generative artwork in the very literal sense that it is capable of reproduction. Through its own governance structure, “Plantoid” unleashes capitalistic tactics to keep its species alive.\n\nReproduction is possible through a system designed by Primavera in which a “Plantoid” eats cryptocurrency. Fun fact: its earliest iteration in 2014 was literally a bitcoin-eating plant. Gathering enough funds until it has enough in its wallet to commission an artist to create the next species, the cycle continues. This process is managed by Plantoid’s smart contract, which automatically opens a call for proposals and manages a transfer of funds to the hired artist. The most recent “Plantoid” is number 15. A “Plantoid” cannot be owned, but they need humans to reproduce themselves. Feeding a “Plantoid” gives you the ability to vote on which artist creates the next one, but there is no potential for profit, neither for the participants or the artist.\n\nThe latest Plantoids have new capabilities and avenues of expression, adding on another layer of its re(production). They are blockchain-based lifeforms that are capable of reproducing physically and digitally, and also create generative audio-visual works (Plantoid seeds). These seeds are created through a conversation with the sculpture. Plantoids’ anatomy is composed of: 1) a “body” which is the metal sculpture integrated with physical computing parts and animated by multiple AI for voice interaction, 2) the lifeforce—or the “spirit,” as the artist calls it—is the Solidity smart contract. The “Plantoid” seeds are audio-visual artworks that act as speculative NFT assets used to attract humans to feed it ETH. “Plantoid” brings generative art and our experience of the blockchain out of the screen. You touch its cold face, “Plantoid“ knows you’re present. It engages with you in a chat until it can’t be bothered. It is disarming, sly, and cool. “Plantoid” shills you an oracle in the form of an NFT.\n\nPrimavera, artist and legal scholar, gives agency to the artwork, not the artist, and says: “This model goes, therefore, one step beyond the traditional logic of open source, in that the art piece actually acquires a life on its own, and is able to evolve independently of the will of the original author.” She first created “Plantoid” in 2014 as a way to illustrate her legal research around blockchain, demonstrating the complex legal questions that arise with an independent system of relationships governed solely through a smart contract. Another aim is to have a mechanism for an artwork itself to have a thriving life and deflect attention away from the artist. It is difficult to imagine that this is not related to the artist’s aversion to being known or depicted digitally.\n\n— Dejha Ti, Operator",

    "description": "The “nth culture” series takes its visual inspiration from Toghu and Ndop textiles from Cameroon, Fingacode’s maternal homeland. This is a part of an emerging theme within generative art to make work related to personal biography. The relationships to the original fabric patterns are clear, but the differences are essential as well. The work isn’t a simulation of the source material, it’s a point of departure. Looking at the full collection of 100 artworks in the “nth culture” series, the common element is an implied grid, with each grid space filled with different kinds of texture. The range of colors, lines, patterns, and densities combine to create vibrant images. The parameters defined in the code create a wide diversity within the images. For example, there are four different ways of using color. Each image has one color palette chosen at random: “rose,” “toghu original,” “regal,” and “ndop original.”\n\nThe title “nth culture” refers to living within more than one culture at once, a reference to “3rd culture” but extending it even further. Contemporary London, Fingacode’s home, is a diverse city, home to large groups of people from all over the world where cultures mix and flow.\n\n“nth culture” was exhibited at Bright Moments London in November 2022, it was fingacode’s first solo exhibition. The work on screen was shown along with clothing from Cameroon to add context for the viewers.\n\n— Casey REAS",
