A few years ago, I attended a Cirque du Soleil show in Las Vegas. I was stunned by the performance, and it is probably one of the best shows I’ve ever seen. An inspiring mix of artists and acrobats, sound, special effects, and production… It had everything done spectacularly.

Cirque du Soleil is a world-class production that travels the world, putting together impressive performances since 1984.

> *From a group of 20 street performers at its beginnings in 1984, Cirque du Soleil is a major Québec-based organization providing high-quality artistic entertainment. The company has close to 4,000 employees, including 1,300 artists from more than 50 different countries.
Cirque du Soleil has brought wonder and delight to more than 180 million spectators in more than 400 cities in over sixty countries on six continents.*

The company amazed its success by working with the best athletes (literally Olympian participants) and all kinds of performers, mixed with outstanding orchestration, to create a powerhouse that produces over $850M in revenue per year.
I thought this real-life experience was impossible to match.
Until last week, after I assisted Bright Moments, Mexico City.

Here are 7 reasons why I think Bright Moments has the potential to become the next Cirque du Soleil…

# 1. Working with Trailblazer Crypto Artists

Since day one, Bright Moments has been collaborating with the most talented generative and crypto artists. Names like Tyler Hobbs (Incomplete Control) and Matt Deslaur (Folio) had their own exhibitions as part of Bright Moment’s past events.

# 2. Next-Level Minting Experiences

Minting alone from your laptop was fun one year ago. Seeing your reveal on a high-definition screen in a unique room is game-changing.
The team worked with each artist to design their minting rooms, creating an ambiance that added much more to the artwork than just seeing it on your computer screen.

# 3. World Class Talks and Educational Content

There were multiple weeks of workshops, and talks, covering topics like generative coded and AI art, Web 3 security and best practices, the generative art market, and high-profile projects like PROOF/Moonbirds.
