**Curator Anika Meier on LEEMULLICAN.PCX:**

> As a pioneer of computer art, Lee Mullican has devoted his life to finding new ways to create images. He embraced new technologies and tools of the day. In the fall of 1986, Lee Mullican participated in UCLA’s Advanced Design Research Center’s Program for Technology in the Arts. The program allowed the then 66-year-old Mullican to start exploring the digital realm. 
The exhibition LeeMullican.PCX presents 12 NFTs that demonstrate the artist’s relentless experimentation. Mullican is an institutionally recognized painter, he is in the permanent collections of the Museum of Modern Art, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, among others. He skillfully used his knowledge of painterly techniques as a guide when he began working with computers and found common ground with his own style of painting and the chance made possible by the computer.

**About the artist:**

Lee Mullican was born in 1919 in Chickasha, Oklahoma and died in Los Angeles in 1998. Upon his graduation from the Kansas City Art Institute in 1942, Mullican was drafted into the army, serving four years as a topographical draftsman before moving to San Francisco in 1946. 

After winning a prestigious Guggenheim Fellowship in 1959, he spent a year painting in Rome before returning to Los Angeles where he joined the UCLA Art Department in 1961, keeping his position for nearly 30 years. He divided the later part of his life between his homes in Los Angeles and Taos, traveling internationally and co-organizing exhibitions at UCLA. A retrospective spanning 50 years of the artist’s work was organized by the Los Angeles County Museum of Art in 2005. 
Mullican is in the permanent collections of the Museum of Modern Art, New York; the San Francisco Museum of Art; the Metropolitan Museum of Art; the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles; and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, among others.
