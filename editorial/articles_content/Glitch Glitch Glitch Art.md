### A brief recap of glitch art and 9 artists to watch

This article was originally published May 16, 2023.

> “Glitch” refers both to unintended consequences and also to effects deliberately designed to make an audience question whether or not the software is working as intended. I think it will also be helpful to consider the glitch in terms of three separate but related forms: 1) glitch as discovery, 2) glitch as aesthetic, and 3) glitch as performance.

Alex Pieschel in Glitches: A kind of history (2014)

Ah, yes, the ancient art of manipulating defects. It's a practice that has been embraced by artistic visionaries throughout history, long before the advent of modern technology such as video games, television, or the digital wonders of *xCopy* and *Deslucrece*. Indeed, some suggest that the movement of cubism, with its bold experimentation and avant-garde approach, served as a major source of inspiration for the glitch art we see today.

The appreciation of visual glitches goes much back much further than the 1980’s - 90’s and the ‘home computer’ retro aesthetic imagery that is often associated with that time.

> In visual investigations, a wealth of Glitch-alike imagery was found and the notion of the accident in art spanning across decades of the use and misuse of media in artistic practice. I would like to draw attention to the cubist movement. While their works are not commonly thought of as ‘glitches’ per se, I believe that they were possibly influential in the way we can appreciate a fragmented style being applied to a digital image today.

Blockchain art and NFTs offer a natural platform for distributing such art, filling a commercial void that previously existed for this type of creation (this argument can also be applied to other forms of digital art).

Here is a diverse collection of glitch art pieces that have captured my attention for various reasons. This list includes artists from different blockchains and styles, encompassing established names and emerging talents.

In no particular order …

Looking at the Screensavers collection, it is hard to imagine another series that fill this definition better… *“Glitch” refers both to unintended consequences and also to effects deliberately designed to make an audience question whether or not the software is working as intended.*
