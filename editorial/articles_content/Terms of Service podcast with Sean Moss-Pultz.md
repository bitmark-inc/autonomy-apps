# Terms of Service podcast with Sean Moss-Pultz

### Bitmark CEO Sean joins Parallel’s co-founder Alex for a conversation where they break down blockchains and the communication challenges around them.

In November 2022, [Feral File](https://feralfile.com/exhibitions) did a collab with [Parallel](https://www.parallel.art/) to exhibit various artworks by our alumni at the [Luxembourg Art Week](https://luxembourgartweek.lu/en).

The multi-day event was an introduction to the NFT space for an audience mostly familiar with traditional art mediums. Being not only the single web3, but also digital booth at the fair, it was encouraging to see genuine curiosity from visitors in tokenised art.

On-chain art was contextualised by a series of talks, including with Parallel’s Alex, and Bitmark CEO Sean.

As an extended, preliminary conversation in October, Sean joined Alex on their [Terms of Service](https://rss.com/podcasts/termsofservice/) podcast, where they broke down blockchains and the communication challenges around them.

Parallel writes on the pod episode:

> Sean has a long history working with blockchains, and Bitmark has been pushing new ways of interacting with them across multiple domains.
> 
> We learned about Bitmark because of Feral File, an NFT marketplace we find to be one of the most interesting of the current landscape. We discuss different ways of representing blockchains, metaphors that might make the concept more understandable, and ways of thinking about them that shed more light on their importance for the present and the future.
