# 10 Iconic One Of One NFTs (1/1s) On Tezos

### I've been doing some research about 1/1s. Here is what I found.

---

This article was originally published 3 July 2022.

To create this list, I looked at the early minted pieces on the Tezos blockchain and talked to many active collectors and artists. Additionally, I checked the market for sales, offers and potential future value. I also ignored big collections (like long-form 100+ collections on fxhash or pfps) because I wanted to focus on rarer and unique pieces.

**<span style="color:white">*Lushtemples — Highlights of the Hike*</span>, Zancan**

Zancan is the top-selling artist in the Tezos blockchain. He has been slowly releasing 1/1s under the Lushtemples collection like *[A broad conversation in time](https://objkt.com/asset/hicetnunc/461707)* and *[Vantage points — Monument edition](https://objkt.com/asset/KT1MEEn4SZ7fD5c4FKXf68hZoWjtwcf4EGLg/1)*.

***Ornamism 2021 | Sketch #001*, Mario Klingemann**

Mario Klingemann aka Quasimondo is one of the artists that sparked the hic et nunc phenomenon. He is known for his AI works. Ornamism is his first minted piece (1st of March 2021) and object #167 on Tezos. By the way, there are multiple 1/1s from Mario from March 2021 that are very iconic too like *[Neural Studies: The Examiners](https://objkt.com/asset/hicetnunc/236)*.

***A01*, Manoloide**

“Cuando olvido mi cuerpo mis pensamientos tan rápido solo encuentro refugio en la belleza de los árboles.”

*A01* has the highest offer in the whole objkt.com market, a whopping 38k Tezos ($54k), but it has been ignored by the collector until now. How much could it be worth?

***Window Still Life 012*, John Karel**

John Karel's *Window Still Life* series is a Tezos classic with just a few 1/1s (most are multi-edition).

Other window 1/1s are *Window Still Life 038*, *Window Still Life 058*, and *Window Still Life 069*.

***0001AI*, Jenni Pasanen**

Jenni is one of those artists that has mastered AI and her *AI* series is a delight for those that love mixing human creativity with adversarial networks. This series features only 1/1s and there are over 100 pieces in there.

***FACES/PHASES - 5*, Adam Disbrow**

Adam Disbrow aka AD_AD is an expressionist painter who is another talented artist that minted very early on the Tezos blockchain. His piece *FACES/PHASES - 5* was minted 20th of May 2021 and is one of the first times you could see his trademark golden square in an NFT.

***Library Of Babel's Missing Links (or) Voids Of Entry*, Tim Maxwell**

“Handmade, no rulers”. You better zoom in to appreciate the small details in this amazing piece.

***Purgatorio*, Ganbrood**

Ganbrood is one of the first artists to experiment with GANs and mint his works on the Tezos blockchain. *Purgatorio* is a collage made with bigGAN that originally had 12 editions. Besides *Purgatorio*, Ganbrood has created other iconic 1/1s like the *Collaborationist* (recently sold for 6k Tezos).

***No name VIII*, Iskra Velitchkova**

This piece is part of the first collection Iskra minted in the Tezos blockchain in March 2021. It is called *Generative Nature* and it consists of 10 limited editions that share the same algorithmic structure.

***Thinker in the Forest of Digital Dreams*, David Cheifetz and Von Doyle**

This one is a collaboration by two hic et nunc OGs. Cheifetz is an oil painter while Von Doyle uses AI to modify historical creations. I think the combination, done in June 2021, is one of the most iconic pieces on Tezos.

Interestingly, the 1/1 format isn’t as popular as others.

In my opinion, it could be because other formats (like gen art long form collections or pfps) attract multiple collectors that keep the momentum going. Nevertheless, 1/1s are much more unique and rare.

As I said earlier, this isn’t a ranking and I’m sure I missed some amazing pieces.

Until next time,
