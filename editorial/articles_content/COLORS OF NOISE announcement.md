### Mark your calendars for our next exhibition, COLORS OF NOISE, showing new work by German visual artist Kim Asendorf. For over a decade, the pixel has been the main building block in Asendorf's work, seemingly alive in his abstractions or rearranged in his iconic Pixel Sorting aesthetics.

For COLORS OF NOISE, curated by Peggy Schoenegge and opening on May 18, Asendorf has developed an algorithm that generates intricate and dynamic patterns of color-based noises, such as pink noise, brown noise, and white noise. These colored noises are visualized in a flickering mesh of lines, creating a moiré pattern — different sounds have different effects, and the listener is directly drawn into the audio-visual experience, immersing into a multisensory artwork.

**COLORS OF NOISE is a series of 50 unique artworks minted on Ethereum, 47 of which will be on sale for 0.25 ETH.**

**Exhibition Opening:**
May 18, 2023 14:00 UTC+0
(7am Los Angeles, 11am São Paulo, 4pm Berlin, 10pm Shanghai)

Collecting begins one hour later

**About Kim Asendorf:**
Kim Asendorf is a German visual artist who works with conceptual strategies and generative systems to create abstract animations, images and sculptures. His abstract visual systems are conceptually set and realized in algorithms that are open to a wide range of interpretations. He works on a per-pixel level to create worlds that mix simplicity with complexity, that never sleep, and that can put the viewer in a mesmerizing state. He loves to experiment, is driven by curiosity, and finds satisfaction when the results of his work surprise himself. With roots in Net Art, he likes to keep his work easily accessible, and the Internet is his favorite canvas. Asendorf also directed the music video for Metallica’s new song “[Chasing Light](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu37zDGvp0s&feature=youtu.be),” which premiered on April 19, 2023 and featured his work in the background.

**Curator Peggy Schoenegge on COLORS OF NOISE:**
>COLORS OF NOISE lies at the intersection of art and technology, combining Asendorf’s artistic practice with new technologies and physical laws. Drawing upon his expertise in programming, the artist has developed an algorithm that generates intricate and dynamic patterns of color-based noises. The algorithm processes these noises by shaping different frequencies, creating different properties of different colors. Their sonic qualities are translated into an artistic display of vibrant meshes of lines that evolve and transform with the changing soundscape. By transforming the immaterial sound waves into pixelated lines in black and white, an abstract flickering image appears that forms a moiré pattern. It becomes an extension of the sonic experience. The network of lines visualizes the audio, emphasizing its characteristics and materializing the colored noise of the sound.
