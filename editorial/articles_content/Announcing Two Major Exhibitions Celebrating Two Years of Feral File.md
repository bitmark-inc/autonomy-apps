Feral File is pleased to announce two exhibitions that get at the heart of Feral File’s work over the last two years: **The Experiment** and **Feral File 1.0**.

To celebrate the launch of Feral File 2.0 — which comprises a refreshed look, a rework of our exhibition program, and a new way to collect works — these two exhibitions pay homage to the “experiment” that started it all, and the amazing roster of artists we’ve had the privilege of collaborating with thus far. 

**Exhibition opening:** 
June 28, 2023
14:00 UTC+0 (7am Los Angeles, 11am São Paulo, 4pm Berlin, 10pm Shanghai)

### **More about The Experiment**

In 2019, Casey REAS, Rick Silva, Addie Wagenknecht, and artist duo exonemo (SEMBO Kensuke and AKAIWA Yae) invited a group of artists to bring one editioned artwork to swap with each other over the course of a week. The experiment was called a2p, short for artist-to-peer network, and it became the basis for the structure and ethos of Feral File. Now, over two years since Feral File launched, The Experiment brings a2p back into focus, with Feral File’s first non-collectable exhibition.

**The Experiment features works from:**

Alan Butler, Andrew Benson, Auriea Harvey XLVIII, Émilie Brout & Maxime Marion, hiroyuki nisougi, Kim Asendorf, LaTurbo Avedon, Lee Blalock (L[3]^2), LIA, Morehshin Allahyari, Nicolas Sassoon, peter burr, Sabrina Ratté, Sara Ludy, Sarah Rara, shawné michaelain holloway, Tabor Robak, Theo Triantafyllidis, and Yoshi Sodeoka
