### Feral File is pleased to announce FeralVerse, an exhibition that explores the myriad ways in which words and image intertwine. Curated by [theVERSEverse](https://theverseverse.com/), a collective of poets, artists, and technologists interested in the creative potential for poetry on the blockchain, FeralVerse is the first exhibition of verse on Feral File. It includes 10 new works, each of which is a collaboration between a writer and an artist and each offered as an edition of 50.

Collectors of the full set will receive an exclusive edition of a poem written by VERSA, theVERSEverse's emergent AI poet, trained on the corpus of poems published by this literary gallery. This poem was seeded using words from the poems in FeralVerse.

Any sets remaining after 72 hours will be broken into individual editions, with each edition priced at $100 USD, until April 16 at 14:00 UTC +0.

> Our Feral File offering — the first exhibition of verse on this platform — is planted here as a seed for the poetry journal of the future, in which authorial imagination is unbounded, language and art exist in symbiosis, and every contributor is a vital force in a literary ecosystem in which connection to verse can lead to collection.
> 
> In celebration of both National Poetry Month and Earth Month, the texts published here as non-fungible Tezos tokens – each a collaborative performance between writers and artists at the avant-garde of web3 poetry, including some of the planet’s most renowned voices – reflect diverse perspectives, aesthetics, and approaches to the worlds around us and inside us, always in flux. Every work invites its reader to step into a reality augmented through the art of poetry, and to engage deeply with the untamed universe of possibilities for writers on (and off) the blockchain.

**Preview of Selected Artworks**

**Spring So Uneasy by Lillian-Yvonne Bertram x Dina Chang**

“Spring So Uneasy” is a collaboration between poet Lillian-Yvonne Bertram and artist Dina Chang, in which Chang’s visuals provide a stunning photographic take on Bertram’s poem “The Body Deformed by Tidal Forces.” The poem is a muscular lyrical meditation on the physics of tidal forces that simultaneously create solidity and changes of season through rotation and gravitational push/pull and threaten destruction when the same forces of these rotating celestial bodies are brought into too close a contact to sustain their individual integrities. The same phenomenon, Bertram suggests, literally and figuratively applies to earth-bound human bodies and the ways people too are bound to an ungodly planet spinning ferociously through the cosmos.

**“Notes From A Hackberry Seed” by Seth Bockley x Helena Sarin**

“Notes From A Hackberry Seed” is part of Seth Bockley’s Nature Speaks! series. This initiative, created through the poet’s position as director of creative engagement for Sovereign Nature Initiative, a web3 tech/theory/art collective, imagines giving human voice to nonhuman experiences, while recognizing the impossibility of fully translating those experiences. Helena Sarin’s visual rendering pays homage to the hackberry seed itself, the wood of the tree, its germination, pulsating, becoming, and the smile and energy with which the poet delivers the poem.

**Futurum Febris by Denise Duhamel x Diane Drubay**

“Futurum Febris,” fruit of the collaboration between the poet Denise Duhamel and visual artist Diane Drubay, takes us on a journey towards a distressing transcendence. The planet becomes a metaphor for the memories and thoughts of the narrator of “Pilgrims,” Duhamel’s poem. Like a path that accompanies the text, going from the naivety of youth to the realization of a conflicting system, the exploration of the two planets invites us to travel towards a feverish future.

The visual piece is composed of an excerpt from Duhamel’s poem “Pilgrims,” encircling the planets like a blue guiding thread. The two rotating 3D objects are covered with photographs of interference colors captured in the sky. One is calming and peaceful, creating a meditative state and a moment of harmony. The second is heated and alarming, causing a sense of fascination and panic at the same time. Drubay uses psycho-active colors and the feeling of total isolation to heighten the senses and embrace new ideas and perspectives.

This work plays with a descriptive narrative that takes the viewer/reader into a scene of changing emotions and states, calling for transformation by creating true impact.
