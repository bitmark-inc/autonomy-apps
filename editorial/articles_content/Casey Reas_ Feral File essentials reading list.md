# Casey Reas: Feral File essentials reading list

### In August 2022, Casey Reas complied a reading list of ideas and references that contextualise digital art and Feral File, from a historical viewpoint. 


While the latest drops and grails in the space are well-documented on Twitter and Substack, I tend to find its history to be less so. This material was great for taking a bird's-eye view perspective on the topic, which was a nice change of pace from the hectic “on the ground” position.

Casey’s list opens with ‘[Before the Boom](https://rhizome.org/editorial/2021/mar/12/before-the-boom/)’, a broad, historical overview, detailing the various ways artists grappled with the ‘ease of duplication [that] traditionally made it near-impossible to assign provenance and value to the medium’.

‘[What is cryptoart?](https://www.artnome.com/news/2018/1/14/what-is-cryptoart)’ goes onto analysing the unique aesthetic that emerged from on-chain expression, covering iconic projects like Rare Pepes.

The [Artnet piece](https://news.artnet.com/opinion/artists-blockchain-resale-royalties-1956903) presents a ‘throughline from attempts to reform the art market in the '60s to artists like Simon de la Rouviere's work today.’ With smart contracts allowing for automatic and trustless distribution of funds, [many artists have campaigned](https://mattkane.com/art/advocacy/minimum-10-nft-royalties-letter-to-platforms/) for institutions to embrace blockchain tech as a means of revising the art world’s legal system.

A common historical–contemporary parallel that often surfaces in the web3 space is the analogy of co-ops and DAOs. FWB’s [editorial piece](https://www.fwb.help/editorial/what-co-ops-and-daos-can-learn-from-each-other) on the topic looks at what the two can learn from each other, to further social and economic justice.

Lastly, as [Feral File’s origin story](https://a2p.bitmark.com/v2/about/en), Casey’s sharing two archival pages from a2p, the project that initiated Feral File. a2p was a ‘speculative exploration into new ways of distributing and sharing digital images, videos, and animations’; a shared online space for artists, facilitated by a blockchain.

We’re soon running a retrospective on the a2p project, with the an archive of the chat log of this collaboration being publicly available for the first time. Watch this space for more on that!
