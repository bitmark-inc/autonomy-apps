### Last year, Silva 3D-scanned hundreds of blooming plants throughout the Pacific Northwest, which he later grafted and pruned into a hyper-flora. In 30-second looping videos, eerie vegetal forms rotate and slice through a fog of atmospheric lights. The series, also titled BLOOMCORE, will be available in 55 1/1 editions, each priced at 0.25 ETH.

**Exhibition Opening**
April 20, 2023
14:00 UTC+0 (7am Los Angeles, 11am São Paulo, 4pm Berlin, 10pm Shanghai)

**Curator Claire L. Evans on BLOOMCORE**
> In Silva’s BLOOMCORE, we encounter beings familiar, yet unknown, and unknowable. Lush rhododendrons, broad-leaved ferns, rare roses, denizens of deep forests: scanned in the spring of 2022, they are each presented in full bloom, at the height of their lives and thus also on the brink of death. As I write these words, most of the real-life plants Silva has volumetrically captured are almost certainly dead, but they’ll remain preserved in perpetuity, on the blockchain, like museum specimens. To me this is profoundly gothic — these blooms hanging outside of time in the radiant computational darkness, promising transcendence, concealing poison (Silva has even included a few poisonous pitcher plants in this collection, vegetal carnivores with alluring, vaselike forms). In this he is like Algernon Blackwood, summoning the “vast dreaming life” of plants, their hidden, distributed way of knowing, their collective ancientness, and the slow, halting way they move across the world.
