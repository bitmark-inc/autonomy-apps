**What is SuperRare?**
SuperRare is an exclusive marketplace that operates in the realm of non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Unlike traditional art markets, Super Rare requires artists to undergo a rigorous acceptance process before they can showcase their artworks on the platform.

This stringent selection ensures that only the highest-quality and most innovative artworks are available for purchase. Founded in 2017, SuperRare was one of the pioneers in the NFT space, setting a standard for authenticity.

**What is a SuperRare NFT?**
NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, have revolutionized the way digital art is bought, sold, and owned. A SuperRare NFT, in particular, represents a unique and one-of-a-kind digital artwork.

SuperRare specializes in hosting NFTs that are limited to a single edition, meaning there are no reproductions or multiple copies of the artwork. This exclusivity adds value and desirability to each SuperRare NFT, making them highly sought after by collectors and art enthusiasts.
