### Feral File is pleased to announce Chain Reaction, an exhibition of inventive experimental gestures that set into motion a course of action. Curated by Christiane Paul, curator of digital art at the Whitney, Chain Reaction features tokenized visual artworks by eight renowned artists, each of which emphasize the concept, process, and capacity to trigger events.

**Curator Christiane Paul on Chain Reaction**
> Chain Reaction strives to underscore the inherent connections between the blockchain as a list of data blocks facilitating the recording of transactions and tracking of assets, and the generative social, aesthetic, and environmental contexts and networks in which these assets are embedded. The works in this exhibition explore their existence as “tokens” beyond just being technological records of a transaction: they function as catalysts in precipitating events or actions, from environmental preservation and sustainability of a creative process to aesthetic choices. NFTs are functionally defined by their non-fungible status. They are capable of encapsulating and proving ownership of digital artworks that are often characterized by malleable, generative, untraceable, or imperceptible qualities. The artworks in Chain Reaction highlight the porous boundaries between NFTs as a mechanism for unique identification, on the one hand, and as a common “keepsake” of a social contract and commitment, or collective action, on the other.

**“Public View / Private View” by Jennifer and Kevin McCoy**

Jennifer and Kevin McCoy’s “Public View / Private View” opens up the artistic process of creation — usually driven by artists’ concepts and aesthetic choices — to a community of donors and art supporters connected to the McCoys. Collectors receive an animated composite of a series of images that are based on pictures submitted to the McCoys by a group of donors of the artists’ work who thereby participated in the NFT’s creation process. “Public View / Private View” is based on the McCoys’ 2018 project “Public Key / Private Key” for which they produced a short 16mm film, donated it to the Whitney Museum’s Special Collection, then issued 50 Ethereum ERC-721 tokens to represent the right to be named as one of the “donors of record” for the film and selected 50 donors from an open call for applications. The tokens were allowed to freely circulate for a period of six months. For “Public View / Private View,” the McCoys asked these 50 donors of record to submit an image personally meaningful to them and created a coded interpretation of it. The interpretations of the donors’ 50 images were then combined into the animation that collectors can purchase as NFT. The 50 donors receive an ink-on-paper version of the image. While “Public Key / Private Key” made the donation process accessible to a wider public, “Public View / Private View” involves the donors in the creation process itself. Using the blockchain as authentication and distribution mechanism, the two projects form a creative chain that not only binds the artists as makers to an expanding community of interested supporters, but makes the nodes along the way a formal part of the work itself. In “Public View / Private View” the blockchain anchors the creation, distribution, and archiving process of the artwork.

**“Seed Protocol - Dynamical Lunar Indigenous Time (DLITE) 43:28:22.0004124” by Amelia Winger-Bearskin.**

Amelia Winger-Bearskin’s “Seed Protocol - Dynamical Lunar Indigenous Time (DLITE) 43:28:22.0004124” involves collectors in her ongoing artwork inspired by seeds and their caretakers. The NFT edition consists of an image of an identical pile of corn seeds that have been colored by the artist in 100 variations, wrapping the seeds in hand-drawn patterns. As still life, the seed piles imagine what the future seven generations of corn seeds might look like, suggesting textile and beading patterns or more alien mutations. Corn is one of the “three sisters” (corn, beans, and squash) according to the knowledge of the Haudenausaunee people. (Winger-Bearskin is an enrolled member of the Seneca-Cayuga Nation of Oklahoma, which is part of the Haudenosaunee confederacy.) The three sisters are grown together, giving nutrients, shade, and support. The “seven generations” concept reminds us that our current knowledge is built on that of the seven generations before us, and that we must make good decisions for our descendants seven generations in the future. 

Each of the seed pile variations has a unique DLITE (Dynamical Lunar Indigenous Time) number, riffing on the Terrestrial Dynamical Time that NASA uses as a timestamp for celestial voyages. The future that Winger-Bearskin imagines for seeds is inspired in equal parts by several sources: the celestial storytelling of the Seneca-Cayuga; NASA’s Project Artemis; as well as the work of her colleagues’ Robert Ferl and Anna-Lisa Paul, plant molecular biologists who lead a team focused on growing plants in space at the University of Florida Space Plant Lab.

Along with the NFT, collectors receive a participation contract and access to the Seed Protocol website, asking  them to contribute to the larger seed protocol project. They will receive regular updates on all online and in-person events related to Seed Protocol project 2023-2024. Collectors will also play an active role in shaping the project by agreeing to make contributions: engaging with a local seed bank or heirloom seed society in their area and uploading information about the organization to Amelia Winger-Bearskin’s Seed Bank Directory or engaging with one of the seed groups with whom the artist is working.

**“The Dorises - Oystercraft from silicon to saltwater” by Ira Greenberg and Marina Zurkow**

Ira Greenberg and Marina Zurkow’s “The Dorises - Oystercraft from silicon to saltwater” allows collectors to purchase an oyster, a unique NFT in the digital ocean. While the outsides of the oyster shells are similar, each of the 100 oysters in the edition is unique. The insides are structured through custom generative software according to four categories, each based on an aspect of oyster physiology, purpose, and lore: Oyster Engineer (plumbing, cleaning, sifting, filtering machinery); Oyster Artist (creating beauty, wonder, inspiration, well-being); Oyster Sex Symbol (aphrodisiacal and sex-changing); and Oyster Kin (with humans who “farm” and eat them). The artists used AI to generate the oyster elements and backgrounds; embedded across the four categories are fifteen unique surprises, with varying degrees of rarity. 

Along with their oyster, collectors receive a unique password that gives them access to the OysterCraftReef website, where they see their NFT come together with the other collected oysters to form a visual reef. As a collective structure, the oyster reef supports real-world projects such as oyster reef cultivation, conservation, and awareness work. After no more than 90 days after the birth of the reef, collectors will vote on distributing the funds generated through their purchase to three different groups supporting oyster reef conservation, which has been identified by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) as a priority. The project title, “The Dorises,” alludes to Doris, a sea goddess in Greek mythology. Doris was one of the 3000 Oceanids, daughters of the Titans Oceanus and Tethys, and represents the fertility of the ocean. Her name connects the two words Dôron, meaning “gift” or “abundance,” and Zôros, meaning the “pure” and “unmixed,” often used to describe fresh water.
